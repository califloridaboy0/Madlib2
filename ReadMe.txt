I want to create a Madlib-type program.

We'll start with a story/script, missing some words.
The user will be prompted to enter nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.
After all blanks have been filled, the program will print the full story.

Eventually, we could come up with alternate sentences
so, the user would still enter a word to fill in the blank,
but also a number to blindly select one of the sentence options.
Eventually, the full story will display.


Update--
I have the skeleton coded. The actually story, i.e. string case options,
 could be improved upon. It could form multiple full sentences
  instead of jamming everything into one sentence.

Maybe we could write it into a more real-world interface, creating
 a website kind of thing with blanks to fill in and drop downs to select
  numbers.
